st.write('Identifying and classifying various types of flowers can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially for non-experts. The subtle visual differences between species make manual classification error-prone. The problem statement of this concept is to build an automated system that can accurately classify flower images, reducing the manual effort and improving the accuracy of flower species recognition. The system should be capable of handling a wide range of flower species and variations, providing reliable results for users.')
