st.write('The "Flower Classification using Deep Learning" concept aims to develop an automated system for accurately classifying different species of flowers using deep learning techniques. The project leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn and recognize distinctive features in flower images, enabling precise classification. By automating the classification process, the project aims to assist botanists, gardeners, and flower enthusiasts in their identification efforts.')
